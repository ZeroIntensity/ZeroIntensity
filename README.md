<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>

I'm 16 and tend to write or contribute to open-source code. Some of my notable libraries:

- [pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is a (joke) library that I wrote to do Python manual memory management.
- [view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is a web framework that I'm working on.
- [pyawaitable](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pyawaitable) is a library for calling asynchronous Python code from an extension module.
