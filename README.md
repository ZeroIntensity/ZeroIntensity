<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>
I am a 15 year old developer who likes to build things for the sake of building.

I specialize in Python and C, especially when you mix the two, but am also fluent in:

- C++
- Java
- C#
- TypeScript (and JavaScript)

## My Projects

[pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is easily what I'm known for best, but it's not really practical in the real world. I wrote it for fun and to prove a point.

[view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is my best work, go give it a star if you would like.

[Hoist](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/hoist) was a rewrite of one of my early ideas. It never got much traction.

[controlmanual](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/controlmanual) is unfinished, but also some of my best work.
