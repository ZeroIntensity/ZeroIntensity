<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>

I'm 16 and tend to write or contribute to open-source code. Some of my notable libraries:

- [pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is what I'm known for, but it's not really practical in the real world. I wrote it for fun and to prove a point.
- [view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is a web framework that I'm working on.
- [pyawaitable](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pyawaitable), a library for calling asynchronous Python code from an extension module.
