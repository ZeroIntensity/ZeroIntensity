<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>
I'm a 16 year old software engineer who likes to build things for the sake of building.

I tend to work with:

- Python
- C
- TypeScript
- Java
- C++
- C#

## My Projects

[pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is easily what I'm known for best, but it's not really practical in the real world. I wrote it for fun and to prove a point.

[view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is my best work and passion project.
## Support my work

Open source isn't super sustainable. To support my work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/ZeroIntensity).
