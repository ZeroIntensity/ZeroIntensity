<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>

I'm 16 and tend to write open-source libraries.

## My Projects

- [pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is what I'm known for, but it's not really practical in the real world. I wrote it for fun and to prove a point.
- [view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is my best work and main focus, as of now.

### Some smaller projects

- [pyawaitable](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pyawaitable), an API for calling asynchronous Python code from a CPython extension.
- [prompts.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/prompts.py), a package for pretty inputs, especially with [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com).

### Joke projects

- [namespaces.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/namespaces.py), C++ style `::` syntax for Python.
- [mutstring](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/mutstring), patch into string methods to allow mutation of the internal object.
- [privates.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/privates.py), access modification for Python.
- [snakedict](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/snakedict), change `camelCase` dictionary keys to `snake_case`.
