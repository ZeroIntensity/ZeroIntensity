<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>

Hi there! I'm 16 and tend to write open-source libraries.

## My Projects

- [pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is easily what I'm known for best, but it's not really practical in the real world. I wrote it for fun and to prove a point.
- [view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is my best work and passion project.

### Some smaller projects

- [pyawaitable](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pyawaitable), an API for calling asynchronous Python code from a CPython extension.
- [prompts.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/prompts.py), a package for beautiful inputs, especially with [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com).

### Joke projects

- [namespaces.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/namespaces.py)
- [privates.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/privates.py)
- [mutstring](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/mutstring)
- [snakedict](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/snakedict)

## Support my work

Open source isn't super sustainable. To support my work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/ZeroIntensity) (or, you can also hire me via one-time sponsors).
