<h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>
I'm a 16-year-old software engineer that primarily develops open source code.

I tend to work with:

- Python
- C
- TypeScript
- Java
- C++
- C#

## My Projects

[pointers.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pointers.py) is easily what I'm known for best, but it's not really practical in the real world. I wrote it for fun and to prove a point.

[view.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py) is my best work and passion project.

### Some smaller projects

- [pyawaitable](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/pyawaitable), an API for calling asynchronous Python code from a CPython extension - this is the secret sauce that makes view.py so fast.
- [prompts.py](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/prompts.py), a package for beautiful inputs, especially with [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com).

## Support my work

Open source isn't super sustainable. To support my work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/ZeroIntensity) (or, you can also hire me via one-time sponsors).
